=head1 NAME

narada-shutdown-services - kill services and their supervisors


=head1 VERSION

This document describes narada-shutdown-services version v2.3.8


=head1 USAGE

    narada-shutdown-services


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Should be executed in project deploy directory (or Narada 1.x project root
directory).

Service supervisors usually started by cron, and may continue working
even after project directory will be removed - with undefined result.

So, if you want to stop and/or delete project you should run this command
after C<narada-setup-cron --clean> to make sure all project services are
not running anymore and won't start again.

Type of services should be in C<config/service/type>.
Currently supported types are: C<runit>.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

  config/service/type
